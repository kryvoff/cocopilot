# Audio Assets — Licenses

## Current Status: Synthesized Placeholders

All audio files in this directory are **procedurally generated placeholder sounds**
created with Python (stdlib `wave` module) and converted to MP3 via `ffmpeg`.

They are original works, generated by the `generate_sounds.py` script in this directory,
and carry no licensing restrictions.

## Files

| File | Description | Duration |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `ambient-island.mp3` | Tropical ambient loop (simulated waves, bird chirps, breeze) | ~30s |
| `monkey-call.mp3` | Excited monkey vocalization (frequency-modulated bursts) | ~1.5s |
| `chime.mp3` | Soft notification chime (bell-like harmonics) | ~1.2s |
| `typewriter.mp3` | Typewriter key clicking (noise bursts with resonance) | ~1.5s |
| `coconut-crack.mp3` | Coconut impact (transient + hollow resonance) | ~0.8s |
| `error.mp3` | Error alert (descending buzzy tones) | ~0.6s |
| `success.mp3` | Success notification (ascending major third) | ~0.8s |
| `goodbye.mp3` | Goodbye melody (gentle descending arpeggio) | ~2.5s |

## Future: Replace with Real Sounds

These placeholders should be replaced with higher-quality recordings from sources like:

- **Pixabay** (Pixabay License — free for commercial use, no attribution required)
- **Freesound.org** (various licenses — check per sound, prefer CC0)
- **OpenGameArt.org** (various open licenses)

When replacing, update this file with the actual source URL, author, and license for each sound.
