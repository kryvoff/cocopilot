*This is a submission for the [GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/github-2026-01-21)*

## What I Built

**Cocopilot** ("Coco the copilot for copilot") is an Electron desktop app that monitors your GitHub Copilot CLI sessions in real-time and brings them to life with dashboards, 3D scenes, and sound.

It watches `~/.copilot/session-state/` for `events.jsonl` files and visualizes everything the Copilot CLI agent is doing — tool calls, sub-agents, messages, errors — across 4 modes:

- **📊 Vanilla** — Dashboard with stats cards, event timeline, activity charts
- **🏝️ Island** — 3D tropical island with Coco the monkey who reacts to agent activity
- **🌊 Ocean** — Underwater 3D scene with Flipper the dolphin
- **📚 Learn** — Interactive tutorials, event catalog, session playback, and a sound library with spectrograms

The app is read-only and local-only — it never writes to Copilot state or sends data anywhere.

**Every single file in this repository was generated by Copilot CLI** — all code, all tests, all documentation, the CI/CD config, even this DEV.to article. The human didn't type a single character into any file. I prompted, reviewed, tested manually, and iterated across many sessions — it was a true collaboration between me and the agent — but every keystroke in every file came from Copilot CLI.

### Testing

The project has 226 tests — unit, E2E, and visual regression — all written by the agent. Run them with:

```bash
npm run test:unit    # 226 Vitest tests
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright E2E + visual regression
npm run test:smoke   # Build + launch + verify debug server
```

## My Experience with GitHub Copilot CLI

**Built in a single day** using Copilot CLI v0.0.410 with Claude Opus 4.6. The total cost was roughly $10 in premium requests — all covered by the GitHub plan, so $0 billed.

I'm a Python developer with ~20 years of experience, but this was my **first TypeScript and Electron app**. I had zero experience with React, Three.js, or Electron — I relied entirely on the agent to choose technologies, set up the project, and write correct code. And it worked remarkably well!

### What Worked Well

- **Spec-first, then develop** — We spent the first 1–2 hours on specs and planning (see `docs/01` through `docs/08`). The specs were still fuzzy since we hadn't done deep research yet, but having them kept the agent focused as the project grew.
- **Test-driven and observable** — We invested in CI/CD and a debug HTTP server early. The agent could verify its own work at `localhost:9876`, and later sessions could make big changes confidently because the test suite caught regressions.
- **`progress.md` as memory** — This file bridged sessions, letting each new session pick up exactly where the last left off. It's the secret sauce for multi-session agent work.
- **Copilot instructions** — `.github/copilot-instructions.md` kept the agent consistent: never committing, always updating progress, following the architecture.
- **Fleet mode with sub-agents** — Copilot CLI spawned parallel agents for independent tasks (rename files + update docs + fix CI simultaneously).

### Surprising Moments

The most fun thing that happened: our plan called for downloading high-quality audio and 3D assets from asset libraries. Instead, the agent just... **started writing Python scripts to procedurally generate all 11 sounds** and **wrote custom Three.js code to create 3D models from scratch**. I didn't even notice until I reviewed the output! No downloaded assets at all — everything is code-generated. This was completely unexpected and honestly delightful.

### What Didn't Work Perfectly

- **Progress tracking** wasn't always flawless — sometimes the agent or I got confused about what had been done. The end-of-turn summaries weren't always detailed enough for me to catch when the agent went in an unexpected direction (like the asset generation).
- **Old dependency versions** — The initial scaffolding used old versions of Electron and React (probably from training data). The first hour was spent updating to modern package versions. Lesson: tell the agent upfront to use the latest versions.
- **External code as context** — I put copies of copilot-cli and copilot-sdk repos in `external/` hoping the agent would read and learn from them. It partially did, but not as much as I'd hoped.

### What I'd Try Next

- **Try different models** — It would be fascinating to build the same project with Gemini or GPT-5 Codex and compare the experience. We actually had Gemini 3 and GPT-5.3-Codex do co-agent reviews of the project (see `docs/plan-review-feedback-*.md`). They provided useful feedback, but the human in the loop was still far more important.
- **Hook into the Copilot SDK** — The SDK has a more fine-grained event system that could enable richer monitoring.
- **Better agent setup** — Custom MCP servers, custom tools, or Playwright CLI integration could make the agent significantly more efficient. I think this whole project could be done in a few hours instead of a full day with the right setup.

It's fantastic that we can take the latest and greatest model (Claude Opus 4.6) and the latest Copilot CLI features (autopilot, fleet mode, plan mode) and build something this rich with so few premium requests. The `events.jsonl` observability that Copilot CLI provides is what made this whole project possible — and I hope projects like this inspire more creative uses of that data!
