# Cocopilot Sounds

## Overview

All sounds in Cocopilot are procedurally generated using pure Python — no external audio libraries needed. Each sound is built from basic synthesis primitives: sine waves, noise, envelopes, and frequency sweeps.

## Sound Inventory

| Sound | Duration | Used For |
|-------|----------|----------|
| ambient-island | 30s loop | Island mode background (waves + bird chirps) |
| ambient-ocean | 16s loop | Ocean mode background (deep rumble + bubbles) |
| monkey-call | 1.5s | Session start (Island mode) |
| dolphin-call | 0.8s | Session start (Ocean mode) |
| bubble | 0.2s | Bubble effect sounds |
| chime | 1.2s | User message / notification |
| typewriter | 1.5s | Edit/create tool execution |
| coconut-crack | 0.8s | Bash tool execution |
| error | 0.6s | Tool execution failure |
| success | 0.8s | Tool execution success / turn end |
| goodbye | 2.5s | Session shutdown |

## Synthesis Techniques

### Sine Waves
Pure tones at specific frequencies. Used for chimes, dolphin calls, and error tones.

### Filtered Noise
Random noise smoothed with a running-average low-pass filter. Creates ocean wave textures and wind sounds.

### Frequency Sweeps
Changing pitch over time. Bubbles sweep upward (400→1200 Hz), monkey calls sweep down.

### Envelopes
Attack-decay-release shapes control amplitude. Bell sounds use exponential decay, clicks use sharp transients.

### Harmonics
Multiple sine waves at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency add richness. Chimes use partials at 880, 1760, 2640, 3520 Hz.

## Generation

Regenerate all sounds:
```bash
cd resources/audio
python3 generate_sounds.py
```

Generate spectrograms and waveform visualizations:
```bash
python3 visualize_sounds.py
open visualizations/index.html
```

## Visualizations

Spectrograms and waveforms for each sound are generated by `visualize_sounds.py` and saved as SVG files in `resources/audio/visualizations/`.

The spectrogram shows frequency (vertical axis, 0–8 kHz) over time (horizontal axis). Brighter colors indicate louder frequencies.

The waveform shows amplitude over time — useful for seeing the overall shape and envelope of each sound.
